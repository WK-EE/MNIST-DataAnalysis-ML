# MNIST-DataAnalysis-ML
#### Author: Wael Khalil

## Program Purpose
This project leverages various ML techniques to analyze the MNIST dataset and determine the top k features used for our classification.


## Running this Project
Note: This program is built using Python 3.7 or later. The IDE used while building it is PyCharm CE.

1. Download and install `Python version 3.7 or later` on your machine.
2. Navigate to the [ml_project]() directory
3. Run the program as a module with real inputs: `python3 -m ml_project`

## Project Breakdown
In this project, the following **Pre-Processing Methods** are implemented:
- Outlier Removal
- Feature Ranking & Selection

**ML Techniques** Used:
- Bayes Classifier
- SVM with Polynomial Kernel

Also, the ML techniques shown above were then repeated while performing 5-Fold Cross Validation on our data.
<br> <br>
Lastly, an analysis of the results was provided on the following questions:

(a) Which of the two ML techniques shown above performed better? (This is based on the highest classification accuracy)

(b) What is the running time in O(n) of each of the algorithms?

## Project Usage:
```commandline
Usage: python3 -m ml_project
